        <h1 class="about-head"> Class test registration should not be this hard. </h1>
        <p class="about-p-one"> Class registration is an incredible hassle for all students. We know that students are busy and don't want to waste time
            looking for classes, deciding what to take, and finding times to take them. That's why we made Schedule Builder. With
            Schedule Builder, students can easily have schedules built for them. </p>

        <p class=" "> Schedule Builder started as a CS224 project and has now turned into a full web application. We hope to continue to add
            more schools and features to Schedule Builder. If you have any questions, business inquiries, or any features that
            you would love to see on Schedule Builder feel free to send us an email at <a class="email" href="mailto:hello@schedulebuilder.com"> hello@schedulebuilder.io </a>      </p>

        <p class="about-donate"> If you love using Schedule Builder, send us some eth at: 0xB97CF0B13275E14877297874c233CD0bdfe9a148 </p>
